Abigail P. Johnson is a Director, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer
of FMR LLC.

Members of the Johnson family, including Abigail P. Johnson, are the
predominant owners, directly or through trusts, of Series B voting common
shares of FMR LLC, representing 49% of the voting power of FMR LLC. The
Johnson family group and all other Series B shareholders have entered into a
shareholders' voting agreement under which all Series B voting common shares
will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of Series B voting common
shares. Accordingly, through their ownership of voting common shares and the
execution of the shareholders' voting agreement, members of the Johnson family
may be deemed, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, to form a controlling
group with respect to FMR LLC.

Neither FMR LLC nor Abigail P. Johnson has the sole power to vote or direct
the voting of the shares owned directly by the various investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act ("Fidelity Funds") advised by
Fidelity Management & Research Company ("FMR Co"), a wholly owned subsidiary
of FMR LLC, which power resides with the Fidelity Funds' Boards of Trustees.
FMR Co carries out the voting of the shares under written guidelines
established by the Fidelity Funds' Boards of Trustees.

This filing reflects the securities beneficially owned, or that may be deemed
to be beneficially owned, by FMR LLC, certain of its subsidiaries and
affiliates, and other companies (collectively, the "FMR Reporters"). This
filing does not reflect securities, if any, beneficially owned by certain
other companies whose beneficial ownership of securities is disaggregated from
that of the FMR Reporters in accordance with Securities and Exchange
Commission Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998).


RULE 13d-1(k)(1) AGREEMENT

The undersigned persons, on February 6, 2020, agree and consent to the joint
filing on their behalf of this Schedule 13G in connection with their
