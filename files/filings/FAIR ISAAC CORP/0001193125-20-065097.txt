<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) <U>Award Agreement</U>. Except for any Award that involves only the immediate issuance of unrestricted Shares, each Award shall be
evidenced by an Agreement setting forth the terms and conditions applicable to the Award (and not inconsistent with the Plan) as determined by the Committee. An Award to a Participant may be made individually or in combination with any form of
Award. Two types of Awards may be made in tandem with each other such that the exercise of one type of Award with respect to a number of Shares reduces the number of Shares subject to the related Award by at least an equal amount. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) <U>Vesting and Term</U>. Each Agreement shall set forth the period until the applicable Award is scheduled to expire (which shall not be
more than ten years from the Grant Date) and, consistent with the requirements of this Section&nbsp;6(b), the applicable vesting conditions and any applicable performance period. Awards that vest based solely on the satisfaction by the Participant
of service-based vesting conditions shall be subject to a vesting period of not less than one year from the applicable Grant Date, and Awards whose grant or vesting is subject to the satisfaction of performance goals over a performance period shall
be subject to a performance period of not less than one year. The foregoing minimum vesting and performance periods will not, however, apply in connection with: (i)&nbsp;a Change in Control, (ii)&nbsp;a termination of Service due to death or
Disability, (iii)&nbsp;a Substitute Award that does not reduce the vesting period of the award being replaced, (iv)&nbsp;Awards made to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-Employee</FONT> Directors who elect to receive such Awards in exchange for
cash compensation to which they would otherwise be or become entitled, and (v)&nbsp;Awards involving an aggregate number of Shares not in excess of 5% of the Plan&#146;s share reserve specified in Section&nbsp;4(a). For purposes of Awards to <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-Employee</FONT> Directors, a vesting period will be deemed to be one year if it runs from the date of one annual meeting of the Company&#146;s stockholders to the next annual meeting of the Company&#146;s stockholders.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) <U>Transferability</U>. Except as provided in this Section&nbsp;6(c), (i)&nbsp;during the lifetime of a Participant, only the
Participant or the Participant&#146;s guardian or legal representative may exercise an Option or SAR, or receive payment with respect to any other Award; and (ii)&nbsp;no Award may be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged or encumbered other than
by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted transfer in violation of this Section&nbsp;6(c) shall be of no effect. The Committee may, however, provide in an Agreement or otherwise that an Award (other than an Incentive Stock
Option) may be transferred pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order or may be transferable by gift to any &#147;family member&#148; (as defined in General Instruction A.1(a)(5) to Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-8</FONT> under the
Securities Act of 1933) of the Participant. Any Award held by a transferee shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to that Award immediately before the transfer thereof. For purposes of any provision of the
Plan relating to notice to a Participant or to acceleration or termination of an Award upon the termination of Service of a Participant, the references to &#147;Participant&#148; shall mean the original grantee of an Award and not any transferee.

Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) <U>Termination of Service</U>. Unless otherwise provided in an Agreement, and subject to Section&nbsp;13 of this Plan, if a

corporate, Subsidiary, business unit or individual performance which must be attained, and the performance period over which the specified performance is to be attained, as a condition to the vesting, exercisability, lapse of restrictions and/or
settlement of such Award. In connection with any such Award, the Committee shall determine the extent to which performance measures have been attained and other applicable terms and conditions have been satisfied, and the degree to which vesting,
exercisability, lapse of restrictions and/or settlement in cash or Shares of such Award has been earned. Any performance-based Award that is intended by the Committee to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall additionally be subject to the
requirements of Section&nbsp;12 of this Plan. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;12 with respect to Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee shall also have the authority to provide, in an Agreement or otherwise, for the modification of a
performance period and/or an adjustment or waiver of the achievement of performance goals upon the occurrence of certain events, which may include but are not limited to a Change of Control, a recapitalization, a change in the accounting practices
of the Company, or the Participant&#146;s death or Disability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(h) <U>Dividends and Dividend Equivalents</U>. No dividends, dividend
equivalents or distributions will be paid with respect to Shares subject to an Option or SAR. Any dividends or distributions paid with respect to Shares that are subject to the unvested portion of a Restricted Stock Award will be subject to the same
restrictions as the Shares to which such dividends or distributions relate, except for regular cash dividends on Shares subject to the unvested portion of a Restricted Stock Award that is subject only to service-based vesting conditions. In its
discretion, the Committee may provide in an Award Agreement for a Stock Unit Award or an Other Stock-Based Award that the Participant will be entitled to receive dividend equivalents on the units or other Share equivalents subject to the Award based
on dividends actually declared on outstanding Shares. The terms of any dividend equivalents will be as set forth in the applicable Agreement, including the time and form of payment and whether such dividend equivalents will be credited with interest
or deemed to be reinvested in additional units or Share equivalents. Dividend equivalents paid with respect to units or Share equivalents that are subject to the unvested portion of a Stock Unit Award or an Other Stock-Based Award whose vesting is
subject to the satisfaction of specified performance objectives will be subject to the same restrictions as the units or Share equivalents to which such dividend equivalents relate. The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in an Agreement for
restrictions on dividends and dividend equivalents in addition to those specified in this Section&nbsp;6(h). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>7. <U>Stock Option Awards</U>. </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) <U>Payment of Exercise Price</U>. The purchase price of the Shares with respect to which an Option is exercised shall be payable in full at
the time of exercise. The purchase price may be paid in cash or in such other manner as the Committee may permit, including payment under a broker-assisted sale and remittance program acceptable to the Company or by withholding Shares otherwise
issuable to the Participant upon exercise of the Option or by delivery to the Company of Shares (by actual delivery or attestation) already owned by the Participant (in each case, such Shares having a Fair Market Value as of the date the Option is

qualify as &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;162(m). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) <U>Limitations</U>. With respect to Awards of
Performance-Based Compensation, the maximum number of Shares that may be the subject of any Full Value Awards that are denominated in Shares or Share equivalents and that are granted to any one Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed
1,000,000 Shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section&nbsp;13(a)). The maximum amount payable with respect to any Cash Incentive Awards and Full Value Awards that are denominated other than in Shares or Share equivalents and that are
granted to any one Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed $6,000,000 multiplied by the number of full or partial years in the applicable performance period. </P>

to this Section&nbsp;12, the performance measures to be utilized shall be limited to one or a combination of two or more of the following: revenue or net sales; gross profit; operating profit; net income; earnings before income taxes; earnings
before one or more of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other adjustments; profitability as measured by return ratios (including, but not limited to, return on assets, return on equity, return on investment and return on revenues or
gross profit) or by the degree to which any of the foregoing earnings measures exceed a percentage of revenues or gross profit; cash flow; market share; margins (including one or more of gross, operating and net earnings margins); stock price; total
stockholder return; asset quality; <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-performing</FONT> assets; operating assets; operating expenses; balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; improvement in or attainment of expense levels or
cost savings; operating asset turnover; accounts receivable levels (including measured in terms of days sales outstanding); economic value added; improvement in or attainment of working capital levels; employee retention; customer satisfaction;
implementation or completion of critical projects; and growth in customer base. Any performance goal based on one or more of the foregoing performance measures may, in the Committee&#146;s discretion, be expressed in absolute amounts, on a per share
basis (basic or diluted), relative to one or more other performance measures, as a growth rate or change from preceding periods, or as a comparison to the performance of specified companies or a published or special index (including stock market
indices) or other external measures, and may relate to one or any combination of Company, Affiliate or business unit performance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>13. <U>Changes in

(within the meaning of FASB ASC Topic 718 &#151;<I> Stock Compensation</I>) that causes the per share value of Shares to change, such as a stock dividend, stock split, spinoff, rights offering or recapitalization through an extraordinary dividend,
the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments to (i)&nbsp;the aggregate number and kind of Shares or other securities issued or reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii)&nbsp;the number and kind of Shares or other securities subject to
outstanding Awards, (iii)&nbsp;the exercise price of outstanding Options and SARs, and (iv)&nbsp;any maximum limitations prescribed by the Plan with respect to certain types of Awards or the grants to individuals of certain types of Awards. In the
event of any other change in corporate capitalization, including a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or partial or complete liquidation of the Company, such equitable adjustments described in the foregoing sentence may be made as determined to
be appropriate and equitable by the Committee to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights of Participants. In either case, any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan. No adjustment shall be made pursuant to
this Section&nbsp;13(a) in connection with the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company, or in a manner that would cause Incentive Stock Options to violate Section&nbsp;422(b) of the Code or cause an Award to be subject to adverse tax

and such Awards or replacements therefor shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms, subject to Section&nbsp;13(b)(3) below. A surviving or successor entity may elect to continue, assume or replace only some Awards or
portions of Awards. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;13(b)(1), an Award shall be considered assumed or replaced if, in connection with the Change in Control and in a manner consistent with Code Sections 409A and 424, either (i)&nbsp;the contractual
obligations represented by the Award are expressly assumed by the surviving or successor entity (or its Parent) with appropriate adjustments to the number and type of securities subject to the Award and the exercise price thereof that preserves the
intrinsic value of the Award existing at the time of the Change in Control, or (ii)&nbsp;the Participant has received a comparable equity-based award that preserves the intrinsic value of the Award existing at the time of the Change in Control and

time of the Change in Control in exchange for payments in cash to the holders as provided in this Section&nbsp;13(b)(2). The payment for any canceled Award that was denominated in Shares shall be in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
(i)&nbsp;the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Committee) of the consideration that would otherwise be received in the Change in Control for the number of Shares remaining subject to the Award (regardless of whether such Shares
are vested or exercisable at the time of the Change of Control), and (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate exercise price (if any) for such Shares. If the amount determined pursuant to clause (i)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence is less than or equal to the amount
determined pursuant to clause (ii)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence with respect to any Award, such Award may be canceled pursuant to this Section&nbsp;13(b)(2) without payment of any kind to the affected Participant. In the case of performance-based
Awards, the number of Shares remaining subject to an Award or the settlement amount of a Cash Incentive Award shall be calculated by deeming all performance measures to have been satisfied at targeted performance. </P>

than Cause within a specified amount of time following the Change in Control, then (i)&nbsp;outstanding Options and SARs issued to the Participant that are not yet fully exercisable shall immediately become exercisable in full and shall remain
exercisable for a period of time to be determined by the Committee (but in no event greater than one year) following the Participant&#146;s termination of Service, and (ii)&nbsp;any Full Value Awards and Cash Incentive Awards that are not yet fully
vested shall immediately vest in full. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) <U>Other Change in Control</U>. In connection with a Change in Control that does not fit the
circumstances described in Section&nbsp;13(b), the Committee may provide in its discretion (in the applicable Agreement or otherwise) for one or more of the following: (i)&nbsp;that any Award shall become fully vested and exercisable upon the
occurrence of the Change in Control or upon the involuntary termination of the Participant without Cause within a specified amount of time following the Change in Control, (ii)&nbsp;that any Option or SAR shall remain exercisable during all or some
specified portion of its remaining term, or (iii)&nbsp;that Awards shall be canceled in exchange for payments in a manner similar to that provided in Section&nbsp;13(b)(2). The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly in such
circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) <U>Dissolution or Liquidation</U>. Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement, in the event the shareholders
of the Company approve the complete dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Awards shall vest and become fully exercisable, and will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of any such proposed action. The Committee will
notify each Participant as soon as practicable of such accelerated vesting and exercisability and pending termination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>14. </B><B><U>Plan

board of directors authorizing the issuance of the Shares. We have also examined a certificate of the Assistant Secretary of the Company dated the date hereof (the &#147;Certificate&#148;) and originals, or copies certified or otherwise
authenticated to our satisfaction, of such corporate records and other records, agreements, instruments, certificates of public officials and documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed and have reviewed

conformed, photostatic or facsimile copies; (v)&nbsp;the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents; (vi)&nbsp;the truth, accuracy and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents,
instruments, certificates and records we have reviewed; and (vii)&nbsp;the absence of any undisclosed modifications to the agreements and instruments reviewed by us. We have also assumed that the Company&#146;s board of directors, or a duly

issuance and sale of the Shares to be issued in accordance with the Plan and that, when issued and sold as contemplated in the Registration Statement and in accordance with the Plan and any applicable award agreement and, where applicable, the
consideration for the Shares specified in the Plan and any applicable award agreement has been received by the Company, the Shares will be legally and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. </P>
